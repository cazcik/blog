I find myself at the crossroads of astonishment and disillusionment when I think about the cybersecurity industry today. Obviously there are many great tools, products, and people we can point to and look at with much satisfaction. All while we gloat about how our industry is progressing so rapidly for being still so young. The question I keep coming back to is, why does it feel like nothing has meaningfully improved?

I must admit I'm no longer in the, "honeymoon phase" when it comes to this industry. It's been five years, which arguably is not very long at all to have fallen out of love with something you once were so passionate about. I hate that its gotten to this point and I'm sure I won't be here forever, but it sucks and begs for an explanation.

I can't help but feel like we have been let down by, "the big players" in this space on what feels like at times is one big psyop. Constantly chasing each new buzzword or fitting in _another_ useless acronym into our operations stack. Vendors, while sometimes useful, have profited massively off the complexity that _some_ of us operate at. And that right there is the big lie, 90% of us do not operate at such a scale.

The truth is good security doesn't scale. This is fine. We can survive without it. What we cannot survive without is a meaningful foundation of first principles based security. You would be surprised the coverage internal security teams can have with asset management, logging, and detections. Even more surprisingly, you don't need a vendor (let alone three) to do these foundational tasks every security team has to do.

Security is a data problem and vendors are very happy to store your data behind fancy dashboards while providing nominal value. It's actually incredible profitable for them. Storing your logs in their S3 bucket and marking up the service 10-30x is a cash printing machine at the end of the day.

Hacking, red-teaming or whatever you want to call it has it's place no doubt. And if you are truly passionate about that then by all means, do what makes you happy. But I do have a problem with people selling dreams of, "breaking in to cybersecurity" by the merits of learning how to hack. This has little to do with actual security in my most honest of opinions. Go on HackerOne or BugCrowd and see what some of the top bounties were about. I guarantee you the reporter didn't learn how to do it using TryHackMe.

Learning security is learning programming, systems design, and data structures/algorithms. Don't let anyone fool you otherwise. The desire to have security people in your org who, "know how to code" isn't enough anymore. From my experience interviewing for multiple different titles and jobs in security is, companies want a moderately experienced developer (junior) who has a vast security operations background.

Security engineers are builders. They don't simply maintain a tool or server. They are building the infrastructure, processes, and workflows their team depends on to do their jobs. I enjoy nothing more than building outcomes for my secops team. It's the most rewarding work I currently do and wish I could do more of it.

To conclude, security operations is hard but we shouldn't be seeking out to make it harder than it needs to be. Think carefully about the actual outcome you are seeking and don't get caught up in the sales and marketing. Hire builders. Tightly couple processes based on first principles. Measure your outcomes. Figure out what works and what doesn't. Iterate frequently.
